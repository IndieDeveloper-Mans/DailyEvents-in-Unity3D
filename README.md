# DailyEvents-in-Unity3D
Implement in your project daily events, which will be useful for some limited events with big rewards and so on.
This script depends on the Server-date-time-in-Unity3D repository files. Please, make sure you have implemented the files from there.
How to add daily events:
1. Create some UI for showing the daily events in your scene.
2. Attach the DailyEvents script to some object in your scene and enjoy!
